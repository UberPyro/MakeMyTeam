<h3>Team Generator</h3>
<p>This simply generates many teams. Note that these teams tend to be bad since the generation algorithm is given little direction. </p>
<form action="" method="post">
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit" name="calculate" class="btn btn-default">Generate</button>

<p><em>Weighting: </em>These define how much a NSI/SSI/GSI is worth (in that order). 
There are default weights which describe "to check" and "to counter". 
(These might not show on Safari). 
See the About page for more information if you want to change these from the defaults (Warning: it's complicated). </p>

<p><em>Optimize: </em>Switches beween NSI/SSI/GSI data and NSI to/SSI to/GSI to data. 
"By" data considers how good a team is at checking/countering, and "To" data considers how good the metagame can check/counter the team. 
Note that both the weighting and the view affect the interpretation of the output: </p>
<ul>
<li>[Check Weighting, By]: Finds teams which check the most: Generates the best teams offensively</li>
<li>[Counter Weighting, By]: Finds the teams which counter the most: Genereates the best teams defensively</li>
<li>[Check Weighting, To]: Finds the teams which are checked the least: Generates the teams that are the hardest to sweep</li>
<li>[Counter Weighting, To]: Finds the teams which are countered the least: Generates the best teams for breaking stall</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Blacklist Rain: </em>Puts rain Pokemon on the generation blacklist</p>
