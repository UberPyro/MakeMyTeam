<h3>Metagame Coverage Ranking List</h3>
<p>This ranks all Pokemon according to a category of coverage in the metagame. 
Note that the way this ranks Pokemon is <dfn>extremely questionable</dfn> but is still interesting to consider. </p>

<p><em>Check Weighting / Counter Weighting: </em>These define how much a NSI/SSI/GSI is worth (in that order) for checks and counters respectively. 
See the About page for more information if you want to change these from the defaults (Warning: it's complicated). </p>

<p><em>View: </em>Switches beween NSI/SSI/GSI data and NSI to/SSI to/GSI to data. 
(Since both are generated in the MCR Generator, this affects which is sorted). 
"By" data considers how good a Pokemon is at checking/countering, and "To" data considers how good the metagame can check/counter the Pokemon. 
Note that both the weighting and the view affect the interpretation of the output: </p>
<ul>
<li>[Check Weighting, By]: What the inputted team can check the least: Generates the best Pokemon offensively</li>
<li>[Counter Weighting, By]: What the inputted team can counter the least: Genereates the best Pokemon defensively</li>
<li>[Check Weighting, To]: What checks the inputted team the most: Generates the Pokemon that are the hardest to sweep</li>
<li>[Counter Weighting, To]: What counters the inputted team the most: Generates the best Pokemon for breaking stall</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Check Level: </em>Choose check or counter as the topic. 
(Since both are generated in the MCR Generator, this affects which is sorted). </p>

<p><em>Make Usage Blind:</em> Normally, the mkmt weights Pokemon by usage by multiplying a Pokemon's set usage with its check weighting. 
The thinking is that it is better to counter 1 Pokemon with 5% usage than 2 Pokemon with 2% usage because the team is more likely to have a 
favorable matchup against a random team on the ladder (5 &gt; 2*2). 
Sometimes, this is unwanted or does not make sense (such as when considering a small fraction of the metagame or counterteaming, 
or when building a team where ladder usage is not representative of what the team is expected to face). </p>
