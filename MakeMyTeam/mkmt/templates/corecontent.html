<p><em>Weighting: </em>These define how much a NSI/SSI/GSI is worth (in that order). 
There are default weights which describe "to check" and "to counter". 
(These might not show on Safari). 
See the About page for more information if you want to change these from the defaults (Warning: it's complicated). </p>

<p><em>Optimize: </em>Switches beween NSI/SSI/GSI data and NSI to/SSI to/GSI to data. 
"By" data considers how good a core is at checking/countering, and "To" data considers how good the metagame can check/counter the core. 
Note that both the weighting and the view affect the interpretation of the output: </p>
<ul>
<li>[Check Weighting, By]: Finds cores which check the most: Generates the best cores offensively</li>
<li>[Counter Weighting, By]: Finds the cores which counter the most: Genereates the best cores defensively</li>
<li>[Check Weighting, To]: Finds the cores which are checked the least: Generates the cores that are the hardest to sweep</li>
<li>[Counter Weighting, To]: Finds the cores which are countered the least: Generates the best cores for breaking stall</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Number Of Pokemon To Generate: </em> Size of the generated core. 
This can be any number, but 2 to 3 makes the most sense. </p>

<p><em>Blacklist/Whitelist: </em> Enter Pokemon Sets into these fields. 
Each entry must exactly match with a set in the Checks Compendium build data so use the autocomplete suggestions to help. 
(The suggestions may not work on Safari). 
Click "Add Blacklist/Whitelist" to input more Pokemon. 
Refresh or return to this page to reset. 
Pokemon inputted here are blacklisted from the generation algorithm (meaning that they won't be in any of the cores). </p>

<p><em>Blacklist/Whitelist Mode: </em>If whitelist mode is enabled, only inputted Pokemon are used by the team generator. </p>

<p><em>Blacklist Rain: </em>Puts rain Pokemon on the generation blacklist if in blacklist mode. </p>

<p><em>Make Usage Blind:</em> Normally, the mkmt weights Pokemon by usage by multiplying a Pokemon's set usage with its check weighting. 
The thinking is that it is better to counter 1 Pokemon with 5% usage than 2 Pokemon with 2% usage because the team is more likely to have a 
favorable matchup against a random team on the ladder (5 &gt; 2*2). 
Sometimes, this is unwanted or does not make sense (such as when considering a small fraction of the metagame or counterteaming, 
or when building a team where ladder usage is not representative of what the team is expected to face). </p>

<p><em>Filter Duplicate Species and Megas: </em>This removes cores containing more than one Mega Pokemon or more than one Pokemon of the same species. </p>
