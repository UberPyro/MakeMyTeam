<p>This project was conceived, designed, and programmed by UberPyro. The name (and the project in general) was inspired from Orda-Y's BreakMyTeam, 
and the name "BreakMyTeam" originates from Zarel's SweeperCalc. </p>

<p>You can contact me (UberPyro) on Pokemon Showdown (I hang around the OU room) or on Smogon if you have any suggestions/concerns/etc. </p>
